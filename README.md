# 100 Days Of Python Code

This a repo for a Udemy course [100 Days Of Python Code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) created by [Dr. Angela Yu](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/#instructor-1)

### input function

To get information from console

### Basic python IDE

## Function and data types explanation

Imagine that you have a fries machine but you try to get into that machine a rock, you should get an error.

For example the function "len" only works with iterable data types, but with numbers not.

- To check the type we have the function type()
- To change data types we can use the python methods like "str" to change a value to string.

#### Built-in Data Types in Python

| Type     | Methods                      |
| -------- | ---------------------------- |
| Binary   | memoryview, bytearray, bytes |
| Boolean  | bool                         |
| Set      | frozenset, set               |
| Mapping  | dict                         |
| Sequence | range, tuple, list           |
| Numeric  | complex, float, int          |
| Text     | str                          |

### Mathematical operatiors

| symbol | operator       |
| ------ | -------------- |
| **     | Exponent       |
| *      | Multiplication |
| /      | Division       |
| +      | Addition       |
| -      | Subtraction    |

### Operation order

PEMDAS. Short way to refer to:

Parentheses
Exponents
Multiplication
Division
Addition
Subtraction

That is the order that follow the rules of priority operators.

Something important is the operator goes from left to right, so, no matter if the operator is / and then *, they have the same importance, so the program will gonna execute the left side first.

### "f" method

Is like template literals in js.

```py
message = f"You have { days } days, { weeks } weeks, and { months } months left."
```

### Charts and diagrams

check [draw.io](draw.io) to make conditional diagrams and charts

### elif statement

you can do as many elifs as you want

[Chart example](https://bit.ly/3oqjOhk) when you don't have an `elif` condition without
