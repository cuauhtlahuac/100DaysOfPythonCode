## Function and data types explanation

Imagine that you have a fries machine but you try to get into that machine a rock, you should get an error.

For example the function "len" only works with iterable data types, but with numbers not.

- To check the type we have the function type()
- To change data types we can use the python methods like "str" to change a value to string.
