# Scope

## Local vs Global Scope

Local scope is similar to have a tree inside of your house

Global is similar to have a tree but outside in the street

## Function scope

All variables created inside of a function have scope, but if, while, or any others blocks don't

Remember that in Python there is no block scope. Inside a if/else/for/while code block is the same as outside it.
