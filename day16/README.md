Think about the different components about a delf driving car. You can brake down into a different modules.


## Imagine a restaurant

Imagine that you have a restaturant and you do all the task, you're de witress, cooker, etc...


You can think in a one man restaurante but the size is limited

### You can hire a bunch of people

Where they each have their own individual roles. Each know the special task, you don't have to tell them how to do their job.

You could see as the manager that only need to organize but not to teach how to do their work. 


## OOP name

The reason is to model real world objects with code.

### Lets model a waiter

 let's think in two things, what it has and what it does
 
has: (attributes)
```py
is_holding_plate = True
```
```py
tables_responsible = [2, 3, 4]
```

does: (methods)
```py
def take_order(table, order):
    # takes order to the chef

def take_payment(amount):
    # money to restaurant
```

## Package
They are a bunch of files and modules that someone else wrote to use them.

### pyPi
[pyPi](https://pypi.org/): The Python Package Index (PyPI) is a repository of software for the Python programming language. (It's like npm:)
